I currently have an Associates in Computer Programming from Chattahoochee Technical College but want to work towords the cybersecurity field. I was born on a military base in Oceanside, CA, and moved to Georgia when I was young. I went to East Paulding High School, I am the youngest of 3 siblings, however if you include my half and step siblings I am right in the middle of the 8 of us. Outside of school I mainly work full time, play video games, enjoy gunsmithing, and fish.
